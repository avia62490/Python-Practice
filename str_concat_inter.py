# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# last_name = "Bond"
# first_name = "James"
# print(first_name + " " + last_name)

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# last_name = "Bond"
# first_name = "James"
# print("The name's %s, %s %s"%(last_name, first_name, last_name))

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# if word=="marco":
#   print("polo")

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# color1 = "Red"
# color2 = "Yellow"
# color3 = "Blue"
# print("the three primary colors are " + color1 + ", " + color2 + ", and " + color3)

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# color1 = "Red"
# color2 = "Yellow"
# color3 = "Blue"
# print("the three primary colors are %s, %s, and %s"% (color1, color2, color3))

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# name = input("What is your name: ")
# if name!="Santa":
#   print("you're not Santa")
# else:
#   print("i'm Bart SImpson, who the hell are you?")

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# title = "The Cat in the Hat"
# author = "Dr. Seuss"
# print(author + " wrote the book '" + title + "'.")

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# title = "1984"
# author = "George Orwell"
# print("The book '%s' was written by %s."%(title, author))

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# if name=="Joshua":
#   print("Shall we play a game")
# else:
#   print("Access denied")

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# city1 = "Chicago"
# city2 = "Pittsburgh"
# city3 = "Minneapolis"
# print("I have lived in " + city1 + ", " + city2 + ", and " +city3 + ".")
