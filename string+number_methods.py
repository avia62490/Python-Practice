# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# print(word.upper())

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# if number > 100:
#   print("Thats a big number")

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
# print("%i plus %i equals %i"%(num1, num2, num1 + num2))

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# print(word[::-1])

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# print(number * 10)

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# word1 = input("enter a word: ")
# word2 = input("enter another word: ")
# print(word1.upper() + " " + word2.upper())

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# print("%s has %i letters in it"%(word, len(word)))

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# if number < 0: print("Thats a negative number")

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
# print("The product of %i and %i is %i"%(num1, num2, num1 * num2))

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

word = input("Enter a word: ")
if len(word) > 5: print("thats a big word")
