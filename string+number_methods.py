# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# print(word.upper())

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# if number>100:
#   print("That's a big number")
# else:
#   print("That's not too big")

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
# print("The total is: " + str(num1 + num2))

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# word = input("Enter a word: ")
# print(word[::-1])

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# number = input("enter a number: ")
# print(number * 10)

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# word1 = input("Enter a word: ")
# word2 = input("Enter another word: ")
# print(word1.upper() + " " + word2.upper())

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# word = input("enter a word: ")
# print("that word is %d letters long."%(len(word)))

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# number = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if number<0:
#   print("that's a negative number.")

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# num1 = int(input("enter a number: "))
# num2 = int(input("enter another number: "))
# print("the product of %d and %d  is %d"%(num1, num2, num1 * num2))

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# word = input("enter a word: ")
# if len(word)>5:
#   print('thats a long word')
