# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

# num = 10
# if num == 10:
#   print(0)
# else:
#   print(-1)

# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# num = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if num < 10:
#   print(-1)
# elif num == 10:
#   print(0)
# else:
#   print(1)

# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.

# num1 = int(input("enter a number: "))
# num2 = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if num1 < 10 and num2 < 10:
#   print(1)
# else:
#   print(0)

# 4. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1 if the number is over 9000, and prints -1 otherwise.

# num = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if num > 9000:
#   print(1)
# else:
#   print(-1)

# 5. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 9 if the number is less than 10, prints 19 if the number is less than 20, prints 29 if the number is less than 30, and prints -1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

# num = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if num < 10:
#   print(9)
# elif num < 20:
#   print(19)
# elif num < 30:
#   print(29)
# else:
#   print(-1)

# 6. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 100 if either number is greater than 10, and prints -100 otherwise.

# num1 = int(input("enter a number: "))
# num2 = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if num1 > 10 or num2 > 10:
#   print(100)
# else:
#   print(-100)

# 7. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 1776 if the number is less than 0, and prints 1979 otherwise.

# num = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if num < 0:
#   print(1776)
# else:
#   print(1979)

# 8. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 100 if the number equals 100, prints 99 if the number is equal to 99, and prints 0 otherwise.

# num = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if num == 100:
#   print(100)
# elif num == 99:
#   print(99)
# else:
#   print(0)

# 9. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the first number is less than zero and the second number is greater than 0, and prints 0 otherwise.

# num1 = int(input("enter a number: "))
# num2 = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if num1 < 0 and num2 > 0:
#   print(1)
# else:
#   print(0)

# 10. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 5 if the number is greater than 80, prints 4 if the number is greater than 60, prints 3 if the number is greater than 40, prints 2 if the number is greater than 20, and prints 1 otherwise (only one print statement should occur).

# num = int(input("enter a number: "))
# if num > 80:
#   print(5)
# elif num > 60:
#   print(4)
# elif num > 40:
#   print(3)
# elif num > 20:
#   print(2)
# else:
#   print(1)
